There are N rooms in a straight line in Geekland State University's hostel, you are given a binary string S of length N where S[i] = '1' represents that there is a wifi in ith room or S[i] = '0' represents no wifi. Each wifi has range X i.e. if there is a wifi in ith room then its range will go upto X more rooms on its left as well as right. You have to find whether students in all rooms can use wifi.

Example 1: 

Input:
N = 3, X = 0
S = "010"
Output:
0
Explanation: 
Since the range(X)=0, So Wifi is only 
accessible in second room & 1st & 2nd
room have no wifi.
Example 2: 

Input:
N = 5, X = 1
S = "10010"
Output:
1
Explanation: 
Index 0 : Wifi is available
Index 1 : Since range of 0th Index is 1
          so, here wifi will be available.
Index 2 : Since range of 3rd Index is 1
          so, here also wifi available.
Index 3 : Wifi is available
Index 4 : here range of 3rd Index is available.
So all the rooms have wifi, so return true.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function wifiRange( ) which takes integer N, string S and integer X as input parameters and returns true if students in all rooms can use wifi or false otherwise.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
        String temp = "10001111000101010010101010";

        boolean i = wifiRange(temp.length(), temp, 1);
        System.out.println(i);




    }
    static boolean wifiRange(int N, String S, int X)
    {
        boolean wifiAvailable = true;
        // code here
        for(int i = 0; i< S.length(); i++){
            if(i -X <= 0){
                String temp = "";
                if(X == 0){
                    temp = S.substring(0, i + 1);
                } else {
                    temp = S.substring(0, i + X + 1);
                }



                if(!temp.contains("1")){
                    wifiAvailable = false;
                }
            } else if(i - X > 0 && i < S.length() - X){
                String forward = S.substring(i, i + X + 1);
                String backward = S.substring(i - X, i + 1);
                if(!forward.contains("1") && !backward.contains("1")){
                    wifiAvailable = false;
                }

            }
        }

        return wifiAvailable;



    }
