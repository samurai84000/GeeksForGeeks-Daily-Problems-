/**Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,5}
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
A[] = {6,1,2,8,3,4,7,10,5}
Output: 9

Your Task :
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function MissingNumber() 
that takes array and N as input  parameters and returns the value of the missing number. **/

int MissingNumber(int array[], int n) {
        
        
        // Your Code Here
        int total = 0;
        
        //I know that a factorial is the multiplicative of all numbers below, but this equation 
        //has the sums of all numbers below so i thought the variable name was somewhat appropriate.
        int addingFactorial = 0;
        
        
        for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++ ){
            total = total + array[i];
        }
        int j = n;
        while(j > 0){
            addingFactorial = addingFactorial + j;
            j--;
        }
        return addingFactorial - total;
    }
